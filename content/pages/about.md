We are a group of Christian adult singles (seperated, divorced, widowed, unmarried) who want to worship God, grow in their faith, make Christian friends, and have fun.  Members of this group create a loving community to support one another through life's hardships and to celebrate life's joys.

Group activities include worship & praise through music, bible study, testimony and sharing time, prayer, games, pot lucks and other social activities requested and planned by group members.  Our members are encouraged to use their spiritual gifts to honor God and bless the group.
