Life hurts.  A lot.  Much of the time.  Many of us have been through so many trials we are tempted to give up.  It can be especially difficult when single.  <!--more--> For some, relationships have been messy in the least or supremely toxic at the worst.  Learning to be vulnerable and trust again can be quite a journey.  Where does one start?  It is often said that doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.  So how about doing something different?  How about starting with ourselves?  It takes a lot of courage to take a good hard look at one's own life.  Sandra Wilson says in her book __Hurt People, Hurt People__, "If we want new consequences, we must make new choices.  If we don't change our direction, we are apt to end up where we are headed."

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a safe place to embark on this journey?  A place where each individual was accepted without judgement.  A place where care and compassion are shown, not with words, but with actions.  In Brene Brown's book __The Gift of Imperfection__, she states, "the heart of compassion is really acceptance.  The better we are at accepting ourselves and others, the more compassionate we become."  In that same book, Brown defines connection as "the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgement; and when they derive sustenance and strength from relationship."

A couple months ago a few people got together with a vision to create such a place.  We have called it Compassionate Christian Singles Fellowship.  First Corinthians 12 talks about the body being made up of many parts.  This is the vision for the group.  That all would be involved in meeting the needs of others.  Everyone has gifts.  Some are highly visible, some are behind the scenes.  All are important to the body as a whole.  As Jesus said in Matthew 25:40 "When you did it for the least of these my brothers, you did it for me."  Whether you are in a place to offer ministry or need to be ministered to, we welcome you to join us.
