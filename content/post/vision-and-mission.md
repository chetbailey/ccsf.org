## A Ministry of Love and Compassion

1.  A special ministry of love, to reach out to those that are wounded in heart; who have lost the desire to live because they were rejected by many.

2.  A place where you can be sheltered from the **Storms of Life**.  Where open arms are always ready to welcome you, whoever you are, especially when you say "I AM SUNK, I AM BEAT, I'VE HAD IT."

3.  A place where anyone can take their mask off.  Let their hair down.  A place where they have the wounds dressed and where we can cry together when no words of comfort can be found.

4.  A shoulder to cry on when everything you've ever wanted in life has been lost in the storm.
